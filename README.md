<p> How can I flush my DNS </p>
<ul>

<li> MAC --> killall -HUP mDNSResponder </li>
<li> Linux --> sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager or sudo rcnscd restart </li>
<li> Android --> Open Airplane Mode --> Close it --> Done </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p> If you are from China and you want to climb over GFW, I recommend you to use VPN (Openvpn, L2TP, Ikev2) or Shadowsocks would be the way to surf Google, Facebook,etc.</p>
<p> Another simple way is replace your local computer HOSTS file 
<br> I recommend this some few hosts resources .<br>

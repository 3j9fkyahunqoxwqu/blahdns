<p> If you are from China and you want to climb over GFW, I recommend you to use VPN (L2TP) or Shadowsocks service is the best way to surf Google, Facebook ,etc.</p>
<p> Another simple way is replace your local computer HOSTS file <br> I recommend this some few hosts resources .<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/racaljk/hosts">https://github.com/racaljk/hosts</a></li>
<li><a href="http://htcui.com/4938.html">http://htcui.com/4938.html</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> The way to flush your dns after you change or edit ur Hosts file </p>
<ul>
<li> Windows --> CMD --> ipconfig /flushdns </li>
<li> MAC --> killall -HUP mDNSResponder </li>
<li> Linux --> sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager or sudo rcnscd restart </li>
<li> Android --> Open Airplane Mode --> Close it --> Done </li>
</ul>
